    <h1>Hi - I’m Eesha and welcome to my portfolio website!</h1> 

    <p>The works I’ve displayed on this hand-coded site are my favorite from the spring 2023 semester and I’d like to think that after reading them, one feels that they know me on a more personal level. There’s no doubt that I’m an expressive person with lots of words to say and feelings to share. My favorite things in life include the consumption of marvelous meals (home-cooking or restaurant hopping), attempting photography, cloud-watching, traveling around this exquisite planet, buying expensive flowers, enjoying every pretty sunset that Boston has to offer, listening to Frank Sinatra and old jazz, and soaking in the company of my wonderful best friends. This site is like a mini consolidated folder of me and I hope it adds plentiful color to who I am!</p>
