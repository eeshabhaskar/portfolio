    <h1>Coming out to my S.O.’s Indian parents: A guide to impressing future in-laws</h1>


    <h3>Don’t worry! It isn’t actually that bad, guys. I was my now-girlfriend’s best friend to begin with and we recently decided to tell our truth to her parents. Indian parents just have endless questions, and we can’t be mad at people for being curious. They just want to educate themselves is all! Their comments and questions were so insightful and they brought so many new points to the table – silly of me to think I knew what I was talking about! Remember, meeting the parents is critical and you gotta do anything for that first impression! I’ll list off some thought-provoking questions we were asked!</h3>


    <p>1. “I just never would have guessed because you seem so straight. You guys don’t really seem gay!”</p>

    <p>I’m so flattered! SO glad we could surprise you J</p>

    <p>2. “If you guys are gay then… don’t you want to attend an all-girls school for college?”</p>

    <p>OMG. So true, didn’t even think of that one. I’ll get started on transfer applications!</p>

    <p>3. Aren’t you guys a little young to be acting like this?</p>

    <p>What a great point. Let me consult some old straight people about this and I’ll get back to you!</p>

    <p>4. “Don’t you guys have more of a…sisterly love?”</p>

    <p>I-…okay even I couldn’t come up with an answer for this one.</p>

    <p>5. And the star question of course…What about your studies???????!!!!!!</p>

    <p>We’re both only at top 50 schools, which is definitely my fault. Should’ve taken into account how gay relationships obviously cause academics to suffer more. I’m not the cheating pre-med brown fuckboy from central NJ you wanted for your daughter, but I’ll try my best to make sure she stays on top of it!</p>

    <p>Honestly, going from being her best friend to girlfriend has been nothing but smooth sailing. And her parents are really supportive about everything, and they care so much. Like one time, we were holding hands in the car at a stoplight and her mom yelled at her to have both hands on the wheel. Obviously she was just being thoughtful and wants us to be safe which is so sweet of her. And they always introduce me as her friend. It’s so kind of them to remind us of the origins and foundation of our relationship. They crack lots of cute jokes too. Sometimes, they even just pretend to forget about the whole entire thing. And sometimes they actually just don’t acknowledge me in the room as a little prank. Such jokesters!</p>

    <p>Their original culture is otherworldly to us, and it’s the same for them. It totally makes sense that her mom cries herself to sleep over this – coming out isn’t easy!!! They definitely find us selfish at times, but its good to be reminded so we can keep it to a minimum. Her dad reminds us of our greedy and individualistic and “western” wants to be with one another. He’s not wrong! It’s almost as if we were brought up in the west…??</p>

    <p>Sure, they constantly bring up that breaking up is an option but that’s okay. They just want us to feel limitless in this life and I can appreciate that! Sure, they also occasionally remind us that they want their grandkids to have a mom AND a dad, but father figures are so important! On the bright side, they don’t need to worry about pregnancy scares.</p>

    <p>Sorry, I’m losing my train of thought here. What was this about again? Oh yeah, impressing the in-laws, haha.</p>

    <p>Maybe, just maybe, just hold that thought about coming out to Indian parents.</p>
