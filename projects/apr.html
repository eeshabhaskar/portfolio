    <h1>"Who Am I?" (as a writer) - Apr 2023</h1>

    <p>As I’ve enlarged upon before, my writing is very symbolic of the way that I process my thoughts and the depth of my perceptions. Creating recognizably vivid imagery through my words remains as natural of an instinct as ever for me. The way I write and the way I speak have felt more and more connected recently, and I predict it’s due to an increase in my own confidence and to having more positive regard for life in general.</p>


    <p>More than occasionally, my mind plays host to a dinner party of emotions that can be sometimes gratifying but sometimes disorienting. It’s the nature of who I am but learning how to harness my emotion has become key to my writing and overall language. I’m happy to say that in 2023 thus far, I’ve been spending more time journaling and recording my nuanced thoughts in random moments. Journaling is something I used to utilize significantly more when I was younger, but lately I’ve exclusively turned to it in times of desperation rather than periodically including it in my life. I believe that writing only in pain made me resent journaling to some extent, and thus made me resent my own thoughts and feelings. Now, it’s reincorporation in my routine has truly helped me feel more deeply into myself and trust my conviction more. When my attitude towards myself improves, my writing naturally improves too, not necessarily in the sense that it becomes more positive, but in the sense that it feels more honest.</p>


    <p>In our previous Writing Remix assignment, I felt the changes in my writing come to life more than in any other assignment. When I was reading through my old submissions for my Communication & Gender class from the fall of 2021 and found the one I ended up remixing, I felt compelled to articulate its content differently. I was writing about growing up with a lack of representation and without the ability to see myself as beautiful in a world where women of color are under what feels like constant scrutiny, in and outside of our cultures. The topic is heavy for me and the way my thoughts were formatted felt too boxy and disconnected. I thought a way to make it really transform into something more vivid was to turn it into a poem.</p>


    <p>I practiced poetry with incredible discipline until age 12 or so. In all my free time that I spent writing, there were periods where I was spending over 75% of that time writing and exploring different forms of poetry. The abstractness of a poem and its ability to capture different ranges of emotion solely based on emphasis, structure, and other stylistic choices showed me the variety in potential that poetry could achieve. It’s been a long time for me since a class has allowed me a stage to choose how I want to say what I want to say, which is something I deeply appreciated about the assignment. I am thankful that I was able to produce a work that feels true to the core of my experience as myself. I feel that I was able to shed a certain honesty that I was not able to before.</p>


    <p>The implementation of an English minor in my college curriculum was an excellent decision, no doubt. Something I still want to push myself to learn is how to communicate myself radiantly but concisely. Avoiding redundance in writing is a strong goal of mine, and I hope that more classes in this department can further my skills. Overall, I feel that my lift in confidence and self-compassion has taken me notably far in my writing and I’m hopeful that I can continue my journey as a writer with patience and resilience.</p>
