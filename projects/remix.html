<h1>"Women Like Me"</h1>
<ul style="list-style-type: none">
   <li>When I was seventeen</li>
   <li>I perpetually wrestled with none other but myself, begging for change</li>
   <li>Resentment followed me with the persistence and loyalty of a shadow, and I obliged</li>
   <li>I successfully did as the shadow asked for many years,</li>
   <li>Drowning in the dissatisfaction</li>
   <li>Of my jet-black hair that no amount of sunlight could turn brown</li>
   <li>Of my father’s south Indian genes and their unyielding presence in my thick eyebrows</li>
   <li>Of the fact that I saw myself in no one and nothing I knew to look up to</li>
   <li>Of my immigrant parents who couldn’t teach me how to be the perfect American</li>
   <li>And in fact,</li>
   <li>They detested my desires altogether</li>
   <li>I was only ten when my mother first told me I was internally racist and yet,</li>
   <li>This only fed fire to the war taking place in my mind</li>
   <li>I spent more and more time becoming increasingly unkind</li>
   <li>To myself, and to the other south Asian girls whose friendship I would avoid</li>
   <li>Not that this was something I particularly enjoyed</li>
   <li>I didn’t need to be explicitly disapproving and neither did they</li>
   <li>As their competitive natures and debilitating insecurities were as clear as day</li>
   <li>I resented them because undoubtedly,</li>
   <li>I was them</li>
   <li>I was also competing aimlessly</li>
   <li>I was also hyper analyzing every existing element of myself, visible or not, to my own detriment</li>
   <li>I was also devastatingly unaware of my own beauty</li>
   <li>We spent our childhoods applauding pearly-skinned princesses and Taylor Swift and Zac Efron</li>
   <li>And that’s all well and fine</li>
   <li>But in all that time</li>
   <li>We never learned to celebrate those who looked like us</li>
   <li>We learned not to segregate ourselves further by not celebrating ourselves altogether</li>
   <li>We spent high school watching our male friends vocally prefer pale, dainty beauties to us</li>
   <li>Us, whose brown skin was an incessant reminder that we weren’t conventional</li>
   <li>Thus, we weren’t desirable</li>
   <li>We learned to despise ourselves at the fact, and each other too</li>
   <li>Mirrors went from stationary objects to my relentless enemy</li>
   <li>Shopping went from a weekend activity to a striving hunt for anything to make me prettier</li>
   <li>Exercise went from an energy release to a mindless attempt to sculpt myself like a Barbie doll</li>
   <li>I’ve rejected compliments like it’s my life’s commitment to do so</li>
   <li>I’ve self-deprecated and wallowed to no end hoping the universe would pity me for the cards I couldn’t control drawing</li>
   <li>I’ve worn myself out dry, I’ve spent myself entirely, I’ve drained myself of life</li>
   <li>All to loathe myself for what I am not able to be</li>
   <li>If self-loathing could cause such inexplicable pain over for so much irretrievable time</li>
   <li>Then I am the antagonist of my own life</li>
   <li>Within myself I’ve fostered such strife</li>
   <li>I’ve miserably watched so many other women like me lose themselves too</li>
   <li>What went on in my head when I was seventeen</li>
   <li>Had been following me for over a decade already</li>
   <li>It followed me here, to Boston, as it did many others</li>
   <li>Somewhere along the lines</li>
   <li>I paid some more mind</li>
   <li>To the parts of me that had been begging for air</li>
   <li>Of myself, I had to realize that there is no spare</li>
   <li>I acknowledged bruises and wounds almost as old as me</li>
   <li>I decided not to live as a ghost of who I could be</li>
   <li>And instead embrace what I was gifted with</li>
   <li>To all the other women like me,</li>
   <li>I hope you learn to appreciate the luscious thick hair that decorates you and wear it naturally with pride</li>
   <li>I hope for you to not evade sunshine in fear that it will darken your skin further</li>
   <li>I hope you remember that beauty goes far beyond the Eurocentric traits we have been taught to exclusively acknowledge</li>
   <li>I hope you learn to love your roots and appreciate how far they have carried you through this life</li>
   <li>As expectations of you come and go and intensify, I hope you hear them less loudly</li>
   <li>I wish for you to accept yourselves candidly and unapologetically</li>
   <li>And to learn to live compatibly with the insecurities that exemplify your humanity</li>
   <li>I hope you learn to uplift other women like us</li>
   <li>You, more than anyone else, know how much we ache for it</li>
</ul>
   <h3><em>Reflection</em></h3>
   

   <p>For my piece, I chose to “remix” a piece from my Communication & Gender class into a poem. I took this course in the fall of my sophomore year and it’s one of my favorite classes I’ve taken at Northeastern. It consisted of some difficult and honest conversations about how presumptuously gendered our world is, and how gendering affects the way we perceive the world. With our specific instructor, we were encouraged to include conversations of race (if they pertained to us), given that race is often not separate from gender when we are considering how individuals view the world.</p> 
 
   <p>The original piece is specifically a short reading response about how gender both influences and is influenced by institutions of education. I referenced two passages from the chapter we had currently been studying; the first was more related to the lack of racial representation in my early education and the second had more to do with the more than occasionally high demands of being a successful female in the world’s eyes. The audience of this piece was certainly my professor at the time, as well as the people in the class who also shared their opinions on the topic.</p>
 
   <p>My remix itself was a poem entitled “Women Like Me.” The poem comes strongly and tenderly from the heart, and I would say my audience is young Indian women who go through the common struggles pertaining to identity, race, and self-acceptance. The poem touches on the impact of lacking identifiable role models in our young ages especially. It goes on to discuss the self-hatred that plagues many young women and how this further intensifies the grueling experience of being a woman of color.</p>
 
   <p>When remixing, I certainly consolidated. My discussion response was meant to be more explanatory, but the topic itself is so huge to me, and so when I was planning my remix, I knew I wanted it to be vivid and more emotional. Poetry is something I’ve pursued since I was six years old and often it is my most preferred method of expression.</p>
 
   <p>I only showed my poem to my girlfriend who is also Indian, and she said it deeply resonated with her. I can be very shy about sharing my writing, especially when it is more vulnerable, otherwise I would’ve likely showed it to a few more of my friends.</p>
 
   <p>I really enjoyed this assignment – it’s definitely my favorite so far. I am happy with the poem I produced and I strongly feel that I reformed my initial piece and solidified its primary content into something that means a lot to me.</p>
