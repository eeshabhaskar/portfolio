    <h1>“Who Am I?” (as a writer) - Jan 2023</h1>

    <p>The way I represent myself as a writer is arguably also a way of representing myself as a thinker. I’ve always been one to be thorough when explaining my thoughts and feelings, certainly one that others would describe as an over-analyzer or overthinker. As the eldest daughter of very young immigrant parents, I became a subject and witness to a revolving door of disorienting conflicts. When facing such clashes, I passionately argued back, always ensuring that my point got across. I was far from submissive and tightly held onto the power of my words. I was coined the rebel of my family and even though they had no mal intent, I consistently felt other. My parents had to grow up quickly and become adults before they could prioritize healthy communication, but they did it all so I could have a different life, a life wherein I could teach myself to process my emotions differently than them. At the age of 5 or 6, I read and wrote at advanced levels and spent essentially all my free time in books or journals, especially since my mom fiercely restricted time spent on screen devices. At age 7, I bought a binder designated to safely keep and organize every writing piece I’d finished; there were sections for book reports, short stories, poetry, journal entries, research papers, and the binder was replaced by a bigger one each year. I spent 4 summers immersing myself in different literacy programs including creative writing, journalism, linguistics among many more. The liberation I felt from writing was and always has been magnetizing. My talkativeness and expressive nature have often been ridiculed by people, but never by the pages I write in. In writing, I found a place where my perspectives would always be respected.</p>


    <p>It used to be something I resisted and judged myself for, but my inherent sensitivity is something I no longer try to defend. I am sensitive and am learning to proudly love that quality about myself. I perceive and feel deeply, and this defines the way I write. I don’t think it would take a scholar to read a piece of mine and deduct that I am sharply detail-oriented and emotionally expressive. I cannot convey anything perfectly, but I’d like to think that how and what I convey is seen as intentional. I am confident that many of my personal traits come through in my writing, and my friends and peers say they recognize my voice and tone when reading my writing.</p>


    <p>Like many others I find myself overwhelmed with situations that words don’t even seem to do justice to. As Ludwig Wittgenstein said, “the limits of my language are the limits of my world.” But alas, I find myself unquestionably dedicated to encompassing my thoughts with words. Writing taught me to not view my mind as cluttered but rather unsorted. My thoughts are rich and abundant, not excessive or redundant. My individual growth has helped pioneer my growth as a writer and as an overall communicator. I used to be a competitive figure skater, and the journal I took lesson notes in was also home to the tear-stained pages wherein I grappled with the physical and emotional burdens of being a young athlete. My sudden switch to a new high school featured collaborative discussions in my English classes that propelled my analytical skills in the classroom and in my own life. The pandemic gave me time, space, and permission to better understand parts of myself that I neglected, as well as abundant time to read broadly and write with more honesty. I look back with a melancholy fondness at my old writing when I sense how much I’ve changed as an individual. My attitude towards writing is that it will always give me a stage, a microphone, and an empty auditorium to represent myself without the threat of any judgment. On a fresh page or e-doc, my new and old and impressive and subpar ideas will always be given a chance to be articulately voiced. Writing has given me the luxury to better understand and appreciate myself, and for that I find myself beyond gratified.</p>
