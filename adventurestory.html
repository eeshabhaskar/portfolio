	This is my adventure report!
    <p></p>
    The unapologetically unpaved Panamanian roads lead to an inevitably choppy drive to Puerto de Carti. Through the corner of my window, I see the sun start to crawl out of the sky as our landscape sharply shifts. The proud metropolis grows further into the distance as our view steadily becomes increasingly bucolic. For a few brief hours, my eyes are glued to the window as I soak in the lush greenery of the idyllic mountains and valleys. Each window of the car that I look out of provides the same exquisite sight, satisfying my eyes with every moment. 
    <p></p>
    We eventually reach the docks along the coast of the isthmus. My friends, Priya and Shivani, and I gather our belongings and make our way to the boat, introducing ourselves to the captain as we clasp our lifejackets and seat ourselves. After setting our things under our seats, we being to make our way to the San Blas Islands. The motor is loud, far too loud for us to converse, and it feels like we are all okay with it. We’ve just had a long car ride and the loudness of the motor creates a paradoxical silence that we all enjoy.
    <p></p>
    The water, so blue that it seems fraudulent, stuns me momentarily before my eyes get hopelessly lost in it. I’ve always been drawn to water, waves specifically. It feels to me, and probably to many others, like the ocean’s form of breathing. Waves are its equivalent to the rise and fall of a human chest, effortless and uncomplicated.
    <p></p>
    Half an hour passes at the speed of what feels like a minute. As the boat begins to slow down, the motor quiets and it feels like I am waking up from some kind of meditative state. We inch closer and closer to the island until we are upon its dreamlike white sands. Two small stray dogs greet us, to Priya’s displeasure. She fears them deeply, and although I don’t understand it, her panic calls my attention immediately to a solution. I get out of the boat first, and enthusiastically call the dogs with me to a set of tables further away. 
    <p></p>
    Priya and Shivani help themselves to drinks at the bar while I find myself occupied with the affectionate pets of the sleepy island. It’s probably the size of two or 3 suburban backyards, and I can’t help but be in awe of its therapeutic quietness. I stand up and decide to walk around the entire island, simply because I can. I take in the moment and appreciate that unlike so many islands and gems of the earth that have been exploited and manipulated, this one in particular is doing nothing additional to impress me. There are no buildings, no artificial charm crafted to make outsiders more comfortable. It’s simply existing in its natural form and I am beyond lucky to witness such a spectacle in my young life. 
    <p></p>
    I notice hammocks between palm trees right by the rocks over which the small waves gently crash. I set my backpack aside and slip into one of them residing under two swaying palm trees. I lay and don’t think for a while I listen to the ocean breathe. I observe the depth of my own breath in the tender moment. 
    <p></p>
    Probably around forty minutes later I have yet to move or shift, and it feels like contentment is being described to me in the experience of simply existing in such serenity. I remember feeling a delicate realization that not every moment spent in my own company, no matter how grand that moment, needs to be a time for me to have a transcendentally profound thought. I remember thinking about fearing a lifetime of heaviness and apprehension resembling my childhood, and how it made me reject peace as a young adult. I remember feeling a willingness to be more present and gentler with myself as I navigate my next chapters, time alone with myself, and a part of life where my independence cultivates a harmony I’ve never known before. I remember feeling okay inside, truly okay, and unbelievably reassured by those bellowing palm trees and the deeply breathing ocean.
